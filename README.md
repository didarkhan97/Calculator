# DK Calculator Project

This is the calculator I created for the first project in SEV-12 Nebula Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp. I made a simple calculator that does basic math such as Addition, Subtraction,  Multiplication, and Division. I also added a button to clear out all inputs and a 00 button to write out the bigger numbers faster.
